## Commit Messages and Pull Request Titles

We use the [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) specification to standardize our commit history.

The commit message summary (or pull request title) is constructed by prepending the emoji corresponding to your change, followed by your change.
Example: `ðŸ’„ Updated the style of the UI`

### Pull Request Title

Same as commit messages, prepend the emoji corresponding to your change.
Example: `âš¡ Improve performance of the app`

## Running the application

To build and run Dot Browser, follow these simple instructions.

You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed for this to work!

```bash
git clone https://git.dothq.co/browser
cd browser
yarn
yarn dev
```

Then open a new terminal window and type:

```bash
yarn start
```

You should now see Dot opening.

Read on for more info about the structure of our app.

## Plugins

Dot Browser splits the components of the app into plugins, these can be found at [dothq/plugins](https://git.dothq.co/plugins).

For example, the addressbar's plugin name is [`@dothq/addressbar`](https://npm.im/@dothq/addressbar)

## File Structure

You can find the `main` electron side of Dot in `src/browser` and you can find the `renderer` side which includes all the UI components and React code at `src/desktop/renderer`.

## Environment Variables

- `NODE_ENV` is set to `production` when compiled and distributed. This has a number of effects:
  - All files are uglified and minified
  - Dot switches to using the `dot://` protocol for Expo pages
  - The code will be harder to modify in `production`
