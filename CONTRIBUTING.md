## Developing Dot Browser

If you want to test bleeding edge builds of Dot Browser, you can [download them from the release page](https://github.com/dothq/browser-desktop/releases).

To build and contribute to Dot Browser, follow these instructions. 

### Depenancies

First you are going to need to install the folowing programs onto your computer depending on your operating system.

#### Windows
**TODO:** Windwos install docs

#### MacOS
Install xcode's dev tools using the following command:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
Please install the following packages through [brew](https://brew.sh):
 - `yasm`
 - `nasm`

#### Debian/ubuntu
Please install the following packages through apt:
 - `build-essential`
 - `libpython3-dev`
 - `m4`
 - `nodejs`
 - `unzip`
 - `uuid`
 - `zip`
 - `yarnpkg`
 - `libasound2-dev`
 - `libcurl4-openssl-dev`
 - `libdbus-1-dev`
 - `libdbus-glib-1-dev`
 - `libdrm-dev`
 - `libgtk-3-dev`
 - `libpulse-dev`
 - `libx11-xcb-dev`
 - `libxt-dev`
 - `xvfb`
 - `nasm`
 - `yasm`
 - `libgtk2.0-dev`

#### Arch/manjaro
Ensure you have the following programs installed on your system: 
 - `git`
 - `nodejs`
 - `yarn`
 
Then run the bootstrapping script to get all of your dependancies installed:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dothq/browser-desktop
cd browser-desktop
# Melon is the build tool used to develop dot browser
./melon boostrap
```

### First build
First, clone the repository containing the code for the desktop browser:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dothq/browser-desktop
cd browser-desktop
```
Now we need to download the source code from firefox. To do this run:
```bash
./melon download
```
This will download the firefox source code. Once it has compleated, run:
```bash
./melon import
```
This applies the custom changes that make Dot Browser special. Once it it has compleated, you can start compiling the browser:
```bash
./melon build
```
This can take anywhere between half an hour to an hour and a half depending on how good your computer is. Once it has finished, run:
```bash
./melon run
```

## Plugins

Dot Browser splits the components of the app into plugins, these can be found at [dothq/plugins](https://git.dothq.co/plugins).

For example, the addressbar's plugin name is [`@dothq/addressbar`](https://npm.im/@dothq/addressbar)

## File Structure

`src/desktop` - Electron files for Dot Browser.
`src/android` - Android files for Dot Browser.
`src/ios` - iOS files for Dot Browser.
`src/ui` - React files for Dot Browser.

## Environment Variables

- `NODE_ENV` is set to `production` when compiled and distributed. This has a number of effects:
  - All files are uglified and minified
  - Dot switches to using the `dot://` protocol for Web UI pages
  - The code will be harder to modify in `production`
